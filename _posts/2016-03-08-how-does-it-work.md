How does it work? 

RoomMate
is a software package that leverages existing hardware from a series of vendors

The
booking interface supports Apple iOS or Google Android tablets, meaning a
variety of size and mounting options are possible

The
server interface runs happily with Microsoft Exchange, Google or as a
standalone calendar within the network 

Interactive
screens with a custom graphical interface can be mounted to the wall or glass
partition outside the meeting room

Supports
wired and wireless networks and can be easily incorporated into existing spaces
as well as new builds and office refurbishments

'Check-In'
feature allows a room to become free if the booked meeting doesn't go ahead
